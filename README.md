# Django - creating API

## About
This repository is my twelfth homework assignment from the Python Pro course. This is my first introduction to the Django framework.
I will make web-site that calls pet-shelter. Tha main idea for this site is to allow users to schedule visits with animals in a shelter. 
The platform enables potential adopters to browse available pets and book appointments to meet them in person.

I have added four app`s to the project:
    - main
    - user
    - blog
    - animals

Those apps registered in pet_shelter/settings.py
Also I have created endpoints in urls.py and view functions in views.py but http methods are not implemented yet.
Added templates, models, migrations

## Run API
- create project folder
- cd project folder
- create virtual environment and activate it
- install djangorestframework

run command in terminal:
  - python manage.py runserver
